# Interactive Benefits from Switching Electrical to Magnetic Muscle Stimulation

This is the repository for software instances (Python script) used for the "Interactive Benefits from Switching Electrical to Magnetic Muscle Stimulation" paper (ACM UIST2023).

For more information, please refer to our paper: https://lab.plopes.org/#MMS

## notes:
Currently, our software pipeine is only compatible with a medical-grade magnetic stimulator (Magstim Super Rapid^2). We hope to release an open-source custom magnetic stimulator someday in the future; so please stay tuned!
